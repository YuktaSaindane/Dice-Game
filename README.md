Game Rules
The game is played between two players.
Players take turns rolling a dice.
On each turn, a player can:
Roll the dice: The result (2-6) is added to the player's current score.
If the player rolls a 1, their current score is lost, and it's the next player's turn.
Hold: The player adds their current score to their total score and passes the turn to the other player.
The first player to reach a score of 100 wins the game.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For creating the game structure.
